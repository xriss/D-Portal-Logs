The country is also on the verge of ending a half-century of conflict as the Government of Colombia negotiates a peace agreement with the region's largest and oldest insurgent group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  On September 23, 2015, the two opposing sides announced they expect to sign an agreement by March 23, 2016.  The United States supports Colombia's efforts to end the 52-year conflict and implement a just and lasting peace.  The U.S. government has been an influential partner in Colombia's progress by advancing security, stability, law enforcement, counternarcotics, rule of law, human rights, and development.  U.S. bilateral foreign assistance of $391 million - a part of the Administrations's $450 million whole of government request to support Colombia - includes capacity building and technical assistance in areas of mutual interest to Colombia and the United States: coca eradication and interdiction; institutional presence and licit economic opportunities in conflictive regions; land restitution; demobilization and reintegration of ex-combatants and rehabilitation of soldiers; respect for human rights; access to justice; protection of and services to internally displaced people, Afro-Colombians, indigenous populations, and other vulnerable citizens; global climate change and environmental conservation through the President's Global Climate Change Initiative; and humanitarian assistance and reparations for conflict victims and vulnerable populations.  The United States' national interests are served by assisting Colombia with the most critical aspects of peace accord implementation once the two sides sign an agreement."

Peru is one of the world's largest cocaine producers, a major money laundering center, a principal source of illegally logged timber and illegally mined gold, and the largest source of counterfeit U.S. currency worldwide. While economic growth has slowed for the past two years due to a slump in international commodity prices and the failure to implement second generation reforms, successive Peruvian governments have pursued judicious, market-based economic policies yielding over a decade of economic growth averaging five percent, which has halved poverty rates, reduced infant mortality, increased lifespans, and expanded access to education.  Peru is one of the United States' most steadfast democratic partners in the region, and the continuation of bi-lateral assistance advances U.S. national security and economic interests."

U.S.~assistance to Bangladesh will address persistent challenges in the areas of agricultural productivity and crop diversity, health care, access to quality education, nutrition, vulnerability to natural disasters, governance and the rule of law, supporting a stable democratic environment, and countering transnational security threats.  U.S.~assistance will continue to focus on expanding economic opportunities for Bangladeshis in targeted areas, improving governance, and developing social services which will greatly contribute to the Government of Bangladesh's (GOB) goal of becoming a middle-income country by 2021 - its 50th year of independence."

Counter-proliferation assistance strengthens Malaysia's ability to prevent transshipments of controlled munitions and dual-use commodities.

U.S. assistance supports the long standing U.S. Jordanian, bilateral relationship by bolstering Jordan's economic and political reform agenda, and by helping Jordan temporarily absorb over 635,000 Syrian refugees and 52,000 Iraqi refugees.

Separately, the FY 2017 Request includes funding within the humanitarian assistance accounts to enable the United States to continue to respond to humanitarian needs related to the ongoing Syria crisis in neighboring countries, including Jordan (see narratives for the humanitarian assistance accounts for additional details)."

U.S. foreign assistance plays a critical role in supporting Honduras' development as a safe, democratic, and prosperous nation that offers hope to Hondurans so they see their future in Honduras and not elsewhere.  U.S. assistance supports civil society engagement in shaping public policy, a necessary component of a healthy democracy.  The President's Feed the Future (FTF) program also figures prominently in the programs to reduce extreme poverty and increase economic opportunity in the poorest rural areas of the country.  These activities will be provided through technical assistance, grants, and loans.  By supporting targeted activities in these areas of intervention, USAID will also help address the underlying factors contributing to migration to the United States.  In October 2014, the U.S. government launched the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America (Strategy), which complements the work undertaken by national governments and multilateral development banks, to support the priority objectives identified in the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle.  The Strategy focuses on three overarching lines of action: 1) promoting prosperity and regional economic integration; 2) enhancing security through continued and expanded Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) activities; and 3) promoting improved governance.  Therefore, the Department of State and USAID's FY 2017 request of $750.0 million in bilateral and regional assistance for Central America - a part of the Administration's $1.0 billion whole-of-government request for appropriations and financing assistance to support the Strategy - includes and aligns the resources necessary to increase economic opportunity, reduce extreme violence, strengthen the effectiveness of state institutions, address climate change and food insecurity, and address challenges that have resulted in an influx of migration."

The Government of Haiti prioritizes investments in agriculture, basic infrastructure, manufacturing, and other sectors to foster economic growth.  The Government of Haiti has also reinforced its commitment to improving and strengthening the health system and services throughout the country.  Access to quality education remains a priority for the Government of Haiti, as it works to enhance standards within schools, improve curricula, train teachers and drastically increase student enrollment.  Haiti further supports reforms that have strengthened the capacity of municipalities to increase tax collection and deliver better services.  Despite these positive developments, the pace of much-needed progress is still hindered by weak public institutions, conflicts between the executive and legislative branches, lack of accountability, and weak state capacity to provide basic services.  Further, this weakened state of governance contributed to the recent impasse over presidential elections, resulting in an indefinite postponement of a run-off scheduled for late January 2016.  The inability to find consensual and constructive solutions to elect a new president before President Martelly's term expired on February 7, 2016, may result in Haiti's institutions being overseen by unelected officials, which could hinder the pace of economic and social development efforts.  These persistent governing challenges only underscore the need for a permanent electoral council and ongoing foreign and U.S. engagement."
