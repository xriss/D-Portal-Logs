     "value": "Dialogue for Stability: Inclusive politics in fragile settings (2016-2020) The number of countries and regions that are affected by conflict and fragility is globally on the increase. In Central America, a number of countries are hard hit by fragility and criminality; in the Horn of Africa and parts of sub-Saharan and West Africa instability and internal conflict continue to persist and in the MENA region, a number of countries are at risk of collapsing as a result of religious and political sectarianism. Also in the Eastern European neighborhood, high levels of tension and the use of force remain very worrisome. These conflicts are not limited to national borders. Increasingly, international dimensions are at play as the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine painfully reveal. The increasing instability at the eastern and southern borders of Europe also has an immediate effect on Europe’s own security and stability levels, as the current migration flows clearly unfolds. These developments require a fundamental rethink of the strategies and responses by the international community, informed by an in-depth understanding of the underlying root causes of the conflicts and fragility dimensions in these countries. To better understand and define its own role and positioning in the changing world order, NIMD recently embarked on a reflection process as part of the preparations for its multi-annual plan for the period 2016-2020. This resulted in the publication of its new Multi-Annual Plan entitled (MAP): ‘Stronger Parties. Deeper Democracy’. The MAP describes the vision, objectives, challenges and priorities for the period 2016–2020 and is underpinned by an elaborated Theory of Change. Its overall vision is “to contribute to legitimate and inclusive political systems which create favourable conditions for peace and security by accommodating divergent views and interests in society and by setting differences in a non-violent way”. Since NIMD is increasingly working in political environments which are extremely polarised and divided and in countries that moved either just out of conflict, find themselves in conflict or are at risk of moving towards conflict, NIMD has furthermore prepared an approach for working in fragile and conflict-affected settings. In line with NIMD’s Theory of Change, this approach focusses on three interrelated levels related to political system, political actor and political culture change. Over the past few months, NIMD has engaged in consultations with the Stabilisation and Humanitarian Aid Department (DSH) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to explore the possibilities for the Ministry to continue its support the NIMD beyond the current subsidy that comes to an end in December 2015. The outcome of these deliberations has resulted in the approval of a first grant under the Strategic Partnership for lobby and advocacy and the invitation to submit a five year programme to contribute to inclusive politics in fragile settings and for NIMD institutionally, on knowledge and innovation, monitoring and evaluation and fundraising. This programme called ”Dialogue for Stability: inclusive politics in fragile settings”, particularly aims to contribute to open and accessible political systems and the legitimacy and responsiveness of political actors in countries affected by conflict and fragility. The programme therefore directly contributes to the vision and objectives laid down in NIMD’s MAP and the goals on inclusive political processes and legitimate and capable governments as defined in the policy spearhead on Security and the Rule of Law of the MFA. Furthermore, it contribute to the aim of peaceful and inclusive sustainable development and accountable and inclusive institutions as defined in the 16th Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) recently adopted. NIMD will concentrate its efforts on a selected number of countries (Burundi, South Sudan, Ukraine, Tunisia and Colombia) where it can build on its existing political and partner networks, knowledge base and infrastructure. These country programmes will be based on a country specific baseline and theory of change, informed by an in depth political economy analysis. Furthermore, explorations and a limited number of activities will be conducted in Jordan, Lebanon, Kurdistan and Israel-Palestinian territories. Depending on the political environments and potential entry points in these three countries and one region, they could overtime evolve into fully fledged programmes. Next to these country programmes, the Dialogue for Stability programme will further deepen NIMD’s knowledge base, invest in its skills-set and develop tools and instruments regarding interparty dialogue, capacity strengthening, political culture and gender diversity and inclusiveness. A specific part of NIMD’s knowledge agenda will be devoted to strategies, skills and expertise for working in fragile and conflict affected settings in recognition of the fact that working in such sensitive contexts requires a tailored approach. Furthermore, NIMD will strengthen its knowledge base on new thinking about participatory democracy and stimulate and explore (programmatic and political) innovation in its new and existing programme countries."

Under the innovating democracy programme two more pilots will be organised (most likely Myanmar and Georgia) plus a follow-up ‘hackathon’ in Colombia related to developing a democracy app. Moreover, building on the 2016 Innovation symposium, an expert network will be set-up that will link academia, civic-tech practitioners and politicians to focus on new forms of representative democracy and the role of political parties in this."

     "value": "BURUNDI’S POLITICAL BACKGROUND Burundi has witnessed decades of violent civil conflict between ethnic groups. Despite the fact that a peace process has made democratic transition possible, strong political distrust and a lack of inclusive dialogue between different groups continue to pose significant challenges. THE APPROACH OF NIMD IN BURUNDI NIMD started to work in Burundi in 2008. The implementing partner organization in Burundi is ‘The Burundi Leadership Training Programme (BLTP)’. In the run up to the 2010 elections, NIMD and BLTP worked on getting the political parties to talk to each other and develop themselves as democratic parties. However, since the 2010 elections – which many opposition parties boycotted – Burundi has experienced several years of serious political deadlock, including a period when the different parties would not meet each other and several opposition leaders lived in exile. In 2013 and 2014, as part of a strategy for unlocking this political deadlock, NIMD and BLTP managed to engage the main 13 political parties in an 18-month capacity building project. This was a series of training sessions on how to develop a political party programme, including topics such as how to write a programme, how to develop policy positions and how to involve members in the provinces in such a process. These were multiparty training sessions so representatives of all the main 13 political parties attended the programme together. So at the same time as providing training on very useful technical information and skills, it was also a significant move towards building trust between the parties. In addition to the different multiparty trainings, NIMD also facilitated the process of parties holding internal party discussions, including consulting with their members in several provinces, and helped them to translate these discussions into policy positions on key issues. 2014 saw the last 6 months of this project and the start of a second project focusing on helping the parties to prepare for participating in the elections in 2015. This consisted of training sessions on topics such as how to select candidates, how to observe elections, how to work within the new electoral legislative framework and how to develop communication strategies for getting messages across to the electorate. These activities were executed both in the capital as well as in provinces esteemed to be potentially risky during elections. NIMD and BLTP also arranged for the independent electoral commission to participate in some of these sessions to enable them to exchange information with the political parties and to increase trust in the management of the electoral process. Democracy Schools Since 2011, NIMD and BLTP have also been running democracy schools in Burundi. The school programme started in two provinces and was aimed at training community leaders in democratic knowledge and skills. Currently, there are schools in 8 provinces. We constantly work on furthering developing the set up of the schools and the curriculum. For instance, the training modules now also address security problems because that is an important issue in Burundi at the moment. This means that the schools are now also open to policemen.   Programme deviations/ToC update: The political crisis that started in 2015, continued in 2016. The nature of political violence changed from popular protests and clashes between protesters and security forces to targeted assassinations of high profile politicians and security officials, extra judicial killings, kidnappings and disappearances. The ruling party has increasingly consolidated its monopoly on power and state institutions. Political space for opposition parties to operate in the country became extremely limited. The Ministry of Home Affairs, charged with the management of political parties, continued the practice of splitting up political parties, creating government controlled versions of opposition parties and denouncing the original. Opposition parties have either seen their leadership assassinated, forced to flee of the country, or unable to organize functionally operating party structures. The exiled leaders of key opposition parties continued to be organised CNARED, a opposition coordination mechanism through which they aim to be recognised and effectively participate in the internationally mediated dialogue process on the Burundi crisis. Due to its composition CNARED remained an unacceptable counterparty for the Burundian government, as they accuse key members of its leadership to have been involved in the attempted coup d’etat of May 2015. The pluriform composition of CNARED also remained a source for internal frictions which further hampered its effectiveness as an opposition platform. \n\nThere have been little indications that the consultations facilitated by former President of Tanzania Mkapa under the auspices of the East African Community have produced a dialogue that will resolve the crisis. In part, this was caused by the hostile position of the ruling party, but the weak and divided opposition also played a role and the absence of sufficient coherent political front of the Heads of State in the EAC region formed a further explanatory factor. The efforts of the UN to support this process and new resolutions of the UN Security Council have also been met with outright refusal and condemnation from the Government of Burundi. In the meantime the Government of Burundi has pushed forward its own internal Burundian consultation process led by the National Commission for Inter-Burundian Dialogue (CNDI). This has been seen as a way to produce pre-determined conclusions that will endorse the position of the ruling party and could pave the way for constitutional amendments that will remove presidential term limits, ethnic quota linked to the Arusha peace agreement and enable further reforms that will negatively impact on political space. While a constitutional revision has not yet taken place, several  laws were passed and CSOs were banned that has already significantly reduced the democratic and civil space. These processes are expected to continue in the following year. \n\nA solution or breakthrough from one of the (international) dialogue attempts has failed to take place. At the same time, Nkurunziza’s position has not been substantially challenged by newly formed armed opposition groups, among other reasons because they did not have sufficient capacity to sustain an armed rebellion. \n\nThroughout the year, there have been speculations that internal divisions within the ruling party and security forces could lead to a challenge to the President’s power from within, but given the failed coup attempt in 2015 it is difficult to assess if this was a realistic scenario at any point during 2016. The threat of rapid deterioration into widespread political and ethnic violence in this case, which could have been the trigger for an international peacekeeping intervention, has not fully vanished at any point of the year. The year 2016 as such, closed with almost as much uncertainty as it started. A continuation of the current political deadlock therefore also presents itself as a likely scenario for (the first part of) 2017."

The polarization between the two main parties, the ruling Georgian Dream (GD) and the United National Movement (UNM) of former president Mr. Saakashvili did not recede. While GD’s overall approval rankings shrank in 2016 and the coalition itself fell apart (after the Free Democrats Party and later, the Republicans left), the UNM had difficulties to re-shape itself and expand its electoral base. This polarization contributed to the deterioration of citizens’ trust in the parliament and in political parties. The two individuals heading the parties continued to exert power from beyond the formal framework of politics and governance. While Michael Saakashvili, currently the Governor of Odessa in Ukraine, continued to address and mobilize (via video messages and online) support to UNM, the former Prime Minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili, remained a defining political force for GD and its governance while officially distancing himself from any political role and therefore denying responsibility. This is a fundamental problem, as governance without accountability undermines the credibility of political institutions and risks portraying democracy as a cover-up for behind the scenes influence by interest groups and individuals. \nThe elections of October 08, 2016 were generally appraised by international observers as free and fair, solidifying Georgia’s position of as a regional leader in democratic reforms. However, there are challenges that merit closer attention: The inability of pro-democracy political parties (The Republicans and the Free Democrats) to clear the 5% electoral threshold has weakened democratic forces in the country. The rise of the nationalistic “Alliance of Georgian Patriots,” which was able to gain enough votes to clear the electoral threshold is a clear sign of disillusionment of the Georgian voters with standing politics and shows that anti-democratic propaganda has taken root in Georgia. \n\n2. Programme & Theory of Change Update\nWith GD currently primed to obtain super majority in the Parliament, it will be highly important that it does not turn its constitutional majority into a political weapon against the UNM and in favour of its own partisan interests; political pluralism must survive and thrive; efforts will need to be made to strengthen democratic political groups both within GD and UNM as well as in other groups and political parties. Therefore, the NIMD will continue its efforts to address the capacity of political actors, further improve the political and electoral playing field and enhance democratic political culture. This will be done through bilateral support programs to political parties, multilateral dialogue efforts to advance the participation of women, youth and national minorities and the operation of Democracy Schools. In 2017, as well as onwards, NIMD’s theory of change of simultaneously addressing the interrelated issues related to political actors, culture and system will attain heightened importance amidst rising anti-democratic sentiments, decreasing trust in political parties and further deepening polarization between the GD and the UNM, with a yet unclear role for the populist and anti-western Alliance of Georgian Patriots to play in that setting. \n.

Political outsiders can only join one of the established political parties and legislative election is dominated by individuals with political or business nexus thus providing limited opportunities for substantive reforms. The extensive power of the parliament to scrutinise and influence the national policies are often under-utilized due to lack of capacity of the Members of Parliament (MPs). Political parties invest little in training and education of their cadres to become good legislators that resulted in low policy initiatives and legislative products.  \nIn recent times, the youth has been invited to participate in politics but they are lacking in capacity and political power due to tight control of party oligarchs and absence of internal party democracy. The potentials within the youth as agents of change have not been maximally utilized and even those who are members of the political parties and MPs are given few opportunities or strategic positions thus becoming an obstacle to the development of an inclusive representative politics.  \nThe main reason for non-responsive political parties is related to their focus on power-gaining and power-sharing rather than serving the constituents. Engagement with their constituents is rare, except during elections. Coalitions between parties are mostly based on obtaining a share in power, mostly in the form of political appointments, and not on a trade-off of ideas and policies. Thus, the coalitions of parties is broad and fluid with little programmatic coherence. Furthermore, the virtually indistinguishable party programmes and ideologies, except perhaps between the Islamic and nationalist parties, makes it difficult for voters to hold parties and politicians accountable for their actions and potentially obstructs idea-based constructive political dialogue.  \nOn political culture, there is a low level of substantive civil-political consultations. The citizens also have few avenues to directly voice their concerns and opinions except by voting in elections which has little impact when it is the same familiar faces running for office and ineffective reses visits. Geographical distance between the politicians in Jakarta and their constituents which are dispersed across the archipelago and a lack of understanding among MPs as \"people's representatives\" added to the challenge. Additionally, there is an utter lack of public trust in the political parties that deepened the disconnect between the two that could further hinder the responsiveness and accountability of parties.\n2. Programme & Theory of Change Update\nThe programme outlook for 2017 is very much in line with the original INSPIRE programme proposal. The programme will remain to be focussed on setting up and facilitating multiparty dialogue amongst young MP’s on issues of shared concern. Capacity strengthening will be added to the programme to strengthen the capacity of the target group in their dialogue skills but also building capacity and providing (innovative) means to contribute to informed debates. Furthermore we will start with activities supporting the parties towards becoming more programmatic.\nIn 2017 we will start actively linking the participating MPs with relevant civil society representatives, making use of Kemitraan’s wide network but also linking the politicians with a representative group of alumni of the former ‘democracy schools’ programme.     \n\nThe Theory of Change will remain unchanged in the light of the political update."

Political update 2017\nGhana has been considered the beacon of democracy in West Africa in recent years as it has experienced a number of years of political stability and economic growth. Yet over time cleavages in the socio political environment have arisen especially relating to political inclusiveness and responsiveness. Especially the youth feel disenfranchised in politics, while women are severely unrepresented.\nIn 2016 political developments have centred on the parliamentary and presidential elections planned for December 2016. There are over 20 presidential candidates supported by a range of new parties. The incumbent and his party (NDC) is deeply unpopular. In late 2015 a number of corruption scandals, including one leading to the suspension of seven high court judges, and lavish government spending led to a number of large public protests in the capital early in the year. The perception among the population that the government mismanaged the recent sharp economic downturn and power crisis which led to steep increases in the price of energy and water, fuelled by the reality of a large budge assistance programme introduced by the IMF last April, has only made the ruling party even more unpopular. \nThe main opposition candidate however comes from the second largest party (NPP) that has faced a number of internal party struggles recently regarding its presidential candidate. The party is also struggling with financing its activities. Despite these problems the NPP is expected to win the presidential election overwhelmingly. \nThere also continues to be a lot of distrust in the Electoral commission and their ability to manage the elections is being questioned. To support the management of the elections an elections taskforce has been established, that includes the national police force, who are specifically working on preventing electoral violence, all the political parties also signed a communique urging people to not resort to violence. \nHowever trust in politics is at an all-time low and political actors will need to work hard to create a more inclusive environment that addresses the corruption and transparency issues they face. The new government will inherit a massive debt problem and an as yet unresolved power crisis. Meanwhile education and unemployment remain high on the political agenda. Political stakeholders will also need to review the way in which elections are managed to ensure more trust in the Electoral commission in the future. \n\n2. Programme & Theory of Change Update\nThe theory of change for the Ghana programme focuses on improving the political system, actors and culture through the inclusion of youth and women’s voices in policy making. This is still a very persistent issue in Ghanaian politics as the run up to the presidential elections show primarily an old guard political elite contesting for power. \nThe programme this year has focussed on preparing youth leaders to engage in the elections in a productive manner and from next year once the elections have taken place the programme aims to develop a shadow dialogue platform that enables youth leaders to interact with each other and the political leadership to ensure inclusive policy making on topics that affect them. For this reason the changing political context supports the theory of change and the programme objectives even more deeply.\nBesides implementing programme activities in 2017 NIMD, together with our local partner, will also develop a plan to ensure the programme’s sustainability beyond 2018 (at which point MFA funding will cease). By early 2017 NIMD will have developed its vision for the future of the programme on the basis of possible scenarios and opportunities currently available. In the first quarter of 2017 NIMD together with its local partner will decide how this goal can best be achieved, including what resources and funding will be necessary. For the remainder of the year the plan will be implemented so that by 2018 a sustainable programme is in place."

There is a stark difference between the governing party, which has a functional structure, and the opposition parties, that attempt to operate while facing persecution and sometimes exist only because of infighting in the parties they originated from. A characterization of the parties grouped by allegiance to either the government or the opposition is provided below, indicating the difference that the current landscape means: The ruling party (CNDD-FDD), is focused on consolidating its bases for the continuous mobilization of members around activities for security building and local development (local infrastructure, building party headquarters, etc.); Two parties which have been integrated into the institutions of the Republic (UPRONA, FNL Bigirimana) face a very uncertain future because despite their legal status and seats in parliament their political identity is questioned. These parties exist in their current form after a split has occurred and leaders of their parties still lead independent political groups (Agathon Rwasa for the FNL and Charles Niditije for UPRONA). It remains questionable to what extent these parties will be able to to reorganize and reconstruct their bases in anticipation of uncertain future elections. Nditije’s and Rwasa’s political group formed a joint list of independents and despite them formally boycotting the elections they won seats in the national assembly. Rwasa and its members decided to take their seats, despite their boycott. Rwasa became the 1st Vice President of the national assembly and several members of Rwasa’s group have been appointed as ministers in Cabinet. Despite Rwasa’s shown effective leadership control over much of the old FNL structures and popularity his group formally is not a political party and this therefore poses significant challenges for consolidation and sustaining his political organization. Still the choice of UPRONA, FNL and Group Rwasa to enter institutions opens up some space of freedom and action they are all trying to take advantage of to find, in their own way, their respective bases to revive them and even lay the foundation for expansion; For the opposition parties united against the third term of President Nkurunziza, which have boycotted the elections and did not win seats in the assembly the focus is on survival. They exist despite the risks and the security constraints exercised by the Government. The functioning of the bodies of these parties is affected by this constraint. The meetings still held have no agenda turned to reconstruction and redevelopment objectives. In light of this report, the actors of these parties residing in the country operate in semi-clandestine fashion. Their leaders are largely abroad in exile. A key group of leaders have formed an opposition alliance called CNARED. This alliance includes a group of former CNDD-FDD politicians who initially protested against Nkurunziza’s third term (les frondeurs) and have since established their own political party (PPD). For obvious reasons this group has no legal status in the country. Another opposition party that initially participated in CNARED but since has decided to take an independent stance is UPD. This party’s leadership also consist of a group of former CNDD-FDD politicians that were expelled from the party in an internal conflict in 2008."

The ability of political actors to negotiate and/or bring together different agendas does not revolve around a programmatic vision, but depends on interests and privileges of groups and actors involved in the issue. In this context, and given the absence of a government plan, the Congress has taken the initiative during 2015/2016 to define and further a political agenda for the country. The issues that are included in the agenda are determined by the following factors: the popular demands that were voiced during the La Plaza demonstrations; the CICIG-MP-US Embassy agenda (fight against corruption and security and justice); the interests of the traditional economic power. While UNE and FCN are the biggest parties in Congress, their interests are divergent. Political alliances with the smaller parties were established to determine the legislative agenda and its (partial) implementation. Multi-actor alliances were also established, including Congress, Social Organization and State Institutions. This allowed for progress on specific legislative and policy issues."

The level of polarization was raised due to president Nkurunziza’s announcement to make himself electable for a third term. This decision has been claimed to be both unconstitutional, as well as against the provisions of the Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement. The current government, that took office in August 2015, is not recognized by the main opposition parties. Apart from that, opposition leaders have been persecuted and harassed, while unclaimed attacks on military bases have taken place outside of the capital Bujumbura. While various international mediation attempts have taken and are taking place, none of these seem to offer a solution to the current situation in the near future. Polarization therefore remains high, and scenarios of increased tension and violence cannot be ruled out."

The office is currently represented by a staff of three people, composed of the country director, a programme manager and an administrative official. This team is supported by a political analyst with elaborate experience and a broad network of contacts in El Salvador´s political society. The country office works closely together with a number of other organizations and institutions, both national and international. During 2014 and 2015 NIMD has worked to build relationships with all political parties, especially those represented in the Parliamentary Assembly. It has also fostered relationships with other key stakeholders related to the areas of work of the Institute. Among them may be mentioned: 1. State institutions: Legislative Assembly, especially the Commissions of Environment and Natural Resources and of Women and Children, Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, Institute for the Development of Women (ISDEMU), Instituto Nacional de la Juventud (INJUVE), Association of Municipalities of the Republic of El Salvador (COMURES), National Institute of Municipal Development (ISDEM), the Supreme Electoral Tribunal and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 2. Non-Governmental Organisations: ASRPODE, Water Forum, El Salvador Environmental Alliance, GAIA, CEICOM, CEPRODE, ISD, FUNDE, FUSADES FEPADE and FUNDEMUCA. 3. Academic institutions: UCA, Universidad de El Salvador (UES) and Evangelical University of El Salvador. 4. Development cooperation entities: EU, AECID, USAID, GIZ, Canadian Embassy, Embassy of Chile, Embassy of Mexico, UNDP and UN Women. 5. Regional Entities: SICA y PARLACEN. Due to the diminishing attention for Central America, it is hard for the NIMD office to obtain additional funding. NIMD has established relations with the main donors and will continue to pursue additional funding opportunities. The SP budget is small, and that means that the activities are quite limited in scale as an important part of the budget is spent on operational costs."

At the same time, their responses have largely remained too general and their political campaign was still focused on personalities rather than political programs; most of them have not yet presented electoral platforms, and so far, quite a few of them concentrated on issues that are at the very bottom of the public agenda. At the same time, it seems that the citizens have been paying closer attention to political manifestos than during the previous electoral campaigns. Still, according to the recent polls, the citizens remain very skeptical about political actors in general."

     "value": "In Honduras, according to long-term researches of democratic political culture (LAPOP 2014), most of the population reveal attitudes of high or low support to the system and low support to some democratic values (such as tolerance to other people´s political ideas), which characterizes the country as one between authoritarian stability with tendency to democracy in risk (LAPOP 2014). Political analysts and key informants consider that there is also an important deficit of compliance to some of the basic elements of the democratic culture and its inherent values -rule of law, accountability, check-and-balances, tolerance, inclusion, participation…- among political actors (e.g.: political parties and its members). The recent sociopolitical history of the country, is proof of this: a coup d´etat in 2009, frequent bizarre decisions from Parliament and Supreme Court, tendency to models of authoritarian rule, corruption scandals and a high level of corruption perception (TI), social inequity, and low Human Development Index (UNDP) increasing levels of political discrimination or violence -including gender motivated. To understand how political actors do internalize democratic values (such as the ones mentioned above), a small survey of 36 participants was applied in July 2016 to young members of the main Honduran political parties (5) in the main city of the country (Tegucigalpa) to ask their opinions and perception about some democratic institution, democratic values and dialogue skills. Young politicians usually offer a good sample of the attitudes and beliefs prevailing within Honduran politics: most of them became part of these political organizations through spontaneous and volunteer registration or after being targeted and selected by recruitment campaign, therefore they have a deep commitment and sense of group belonging that make their internalized opinions about certain issues, highly representative of what other people alike them think. Political actors can be more or less aware of the values (democratic or antidemocratic) implicit in their opinions and actions. Specific trainings designed for political actors (like the NIMD Schools for Democracy) can provide tools and exercises to facilitate the internalization and practice of democratic values, rule of law and gender sensitive & inclusive politics, however it is necessary to measure how much these topics are internalized before and after the trainings. The data collected with the referred sample of young politicians will provide in the future a standard of comparison of this awareness. Additionally, data collected with similar questionnaires applied before and after each training of the School of Democracy, will offer evidence of any change in the awareness and internalization of such values."

To overcome polarization and mistrust resulting from the 2013 general elections, the ruling National Party *(without a majority in Parliament)- managed to establish a governing alliance (1) with the Liberal party (27 seats and former main opposite party within the traditional bipartisan system), other minority parties and defectors from opposition parties, to take control of the legislative branch and the legislative process. This tactical alliance has proved to be fruitful for both parties: it helped them to enact laws, to approve Budgetary provisions, to control the board of the Parliament and decisive Ordinary Committees and as the pivotal base of the election of the new Supreme Court of Justice (together with other minority political forces). On the other hand, the governing alliance diminished the political influence and possibilities of the other two main opposition parties (Libre and PAC) However, in some relevant occasions Liberal party PMs did not follow this dynamic -blocking opposition parties- and voted together with Libre and PAC (against a constitutional reform and the appointment of a high state official) proving that the alliance with National Party has limits. The capability to attract and relate to CS actors for the enactment of legislation and its performance on policy goals is limited and it depends mainly on the issue. That is the case of relevant themes for NIMD."

He stresses the large differences between the vision of the opposition and the ruling party, and the lack of willingness to participate in any meaningful dialogue. While the government has launched its own dialogue process, this is controlled by the ruling party and does not entail a shared agenda towards peace and stability. The EAC continues its support for Mkapa’s attempt and pressure on the government. New rounds of talks are expected in October."

However, due to the peace process there is a window of opportunity for political stakeholders to make changes in order to implement what was agreed upon under the “political participation” part of the accord. The legislative changes that need to be made constitute an important opportunity for NIMD to promote the aperture of the political system. The President submitted a constitutional reform act to Congress that establishes a simplified process to approve the legal reforms required to implement the Peace Agreement that has been signed with the FARC. In spite of the opportunity to make significant changes to Colombia’s political system, a strong polarization has characterized the current political scenario. The Government coalition and a large part of civil society promote the ratification of the peace agreements, in contrast to the Centro Democratico political party that has several unresolved issues with the agreement. The data collected shows evidence of a good level of attendance during NIMD events, and political stakeholders mention the importance of the support of NIMD."

Over the last year, political alliances between political actors have been mainly pragmatic: National Party (ruling) succeeded in maintaining the governing alliance with the Liberal party (opposition) within Parliament. The election of a new Supreme Court (15 magistrates in January-February 2016) represented a big challenge for both parties because a qualified majority voting was needed; however, both parties finally succeeded in getting the 2/3 of the votes (86 from 128 seats), by adding votes from minority parties and defectors from opposition parties. 0 active alliance between political actors to perform an integral political reform. 1 active alliance between political actors to support the enactment of politics/campaign financing law. 1 active alliance between political actors to implement 50% quota (gender parity) and rank ordering rules (“zipper shape”) (via regulation). 0 active alliance between political actors to approve new fiscal and tax reforms. 0 active alliance between political actors on climatic change and water management issues.

CS stakeholders did not produce relevant position papers showing joint opinions or alliances about political/electoral reform or campaign financing. • 1 active alliance between political actors and CS stakeholders to implement 50% quota (gender parity) and rank ordering rules (“zipper shape”) in law reform Political actors and CS stakeholders have been very active (and proactive) in showing public joint positions (policy proposals and manifestos), between multiparty political actors (1) and between political and CS actors (1). The need of implementation of an important law reform that obliges to incorporate 50% women quota, in alternate positions, in electoral lists for the 2017 elections, provided an opportunity for women MPs, politicians and CS actors to work together and propose regulation. • 1 partial active alliance between political actors and CS stakeholders on fiscal and tax reforms. In tax (fiscal) reform, there is no evidence of a broad and permanent alliance between political and CS actors. However, the Executive branch introduced a bill into Parliament which had previous, partial, consultation with CS stakeholders; active alliances between political actors and between political actors and CS stakeholders are foreseen in order to have consensus for a new Tax Code • 0 active alliance between political actors and/or political actors and CS stakeholders on climatic change and water management issues. climatic change and water management, there is no active alliance between political actors nor relevant ones between political actors and CS stakeholders (0)."

Regarding parties outside of parliament, recent experience shows they have often played the role of catalyst for reform without actually initiating things in this respect owing to the above-mentioned difficulties in terms of proposing laws."

The collected data shows that parties assess themselves with an average of 81% out of a maximum of 100%. Particular weaknesses in political parties were identified in the strategic planning (61%) and training (76%) categories which produced the lowest results. It is worth noticing that almost all political parties have a positive perception regarding their accountability but this is rather a consequence of legal regulation, and not of the voluntary choice of the parties. In fact, most of them comply only with the minimums established by law."

In part because of NIMD’s effort to support political parties in the development of a political programme, a large number of political parties developed a political programme in the course of NIMD’s trainings: out of 13 parties, 11 developed a programme. Only 11 of these 13 belonged to the key political parties at the time. Out of these 11, only 2 (CNDD and UPRONA) did not have a programme publicly available before the 2015 elections. However, most political parties did not use the programmes actively in the campaign running up to the 2015 elections. This is an important qualification, that needs to be monitored for the mid and end term measurements."
